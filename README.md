#What does it do? 
It helps you generate themes from your cssVars. 
It automaticly scans the page for any cssvars and checks if those are colors, if that's the case, adds them to the list and renders in the editable window.
You can edit the values manually if you want, or enter new ones that will be rendered on enter keypress.


## Get started
