## What is it? 
It's a svelte component that helps you generate themes from your cssvars.

It automaticly scans the page for any cssvars and checks if those are colors, if that's the case, adds them to the list and renders in the editable window.

You can generate or type in new values that will be rendered on enter keypress.


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
