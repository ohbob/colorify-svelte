##What is it? 
It's a svelte component that helps you generate themes from your cssvars.

It automaticly scans the page for any cssvars and checks if those are colors, if that's the case, adds them to the list and renders in the editable window.

You can edit the values manually if you want, or type new ones that will be rendered on enter key.


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
